# Stuff needed to survive in the mountain

Here you can find a list of stuff that you should have in you bag in order to survive a camp in the mountain. It is strongly discouraged to have things in your hands during the hike.

The equipment is divided in `clothing`, `food`, and `everything else`.

## Clothing

Clothing is composed of three layers of clothes, from innermost to outermost. During the climb is advisable to have light clothing because you will sweat. With a sweater or vest will be enough for 3/4 of the trip.

### First layer

For warm sleeping or walking
