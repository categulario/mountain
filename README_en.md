# Stuff needed to survive in the mountain

Here you can find a list of stuff that you should have in you bag in order to survive a camp in the mountain. It is strongly discouraged to have things in your hands during the hike.

The equipment is divided in `clothing`, `food`, and `everything else`.

## Clothing

Clothing is composed of three layers of clothes, from innermost to outermost. During the climb is advisable to have light clothing because you will sweat. With a sweater or vest will be enough for 3/4 of the trip.

### First layer

For warm sleeping or walking

* socks

### Second layer

* Sweater
* another pair of socks
* waterproff footwear advisable. Comfortable is required

### Third layer

### During the night

* Sleeping bag

## Food

Please remember that it's hard to cook in the mountain so bring easy to transport, already prepared food. Everyone will ship its own food to the mountain so administer the weight and space wisely.

You own your food but we always share during the trip.

It's a good idea to have:
* quesadillas
* sandwiches
* cheese
* coffee and tea

I'd suggest having 2 lt of water or more. Although we can find water during the climb, it's not advisable to rely on that. Ask about the water situation to someone to make a better decision.

## Everything else

Useful stuff to have in your bag

- lamp (headlamp recommended)
- knife (have you ever seen the movie `127 hours`?)
- cup

## Shared

The following things are needed per group, ask about what is needed and what is not.

* tent
* pot
* stove
* first aid kit
* sugar
